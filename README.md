# Babysitter for Suncadia / Tumble Creek (weekends)

Hello! I am excited to introduce my daughter, Sophia, who is offering her babysitting services to families in the Suncadia area on the weekends. Sophia is a 12-year-old girl who has been certified by the Red Cross as a babysitter. She is growing up with two younger siblings, which has given her plenty of experience and practice in taking care of children. Our family is lucky to have a beautiful home in Suncadia, and we understand how important it is to find reliable and trustworthy babysitters in the area.

Sophia has always been responsible and reliable, and she loves coming up with fun activities to keep kids entertained. Sophia is kind and caring, and she understands the importance of creating a safe environment for the children she cares for.

Contact her mom today to schedule a babysitting appointment! Call, text or email Rachel, Sophias mom, at 206-612-2137 or rachelhaslhofer@outlook.com. Thank you!
